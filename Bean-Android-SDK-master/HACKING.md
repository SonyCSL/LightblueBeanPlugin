# Developer Guide

This file contains instructions that apply to developers only.

## Run integration tests

You can build, install and execute the android integration tests with gradle:

```sh
$ ./gradlew connectedAndroidTest --continue
```

And then take a peek at the results:

```sh
$ firefox sdk/build/outputs/reports/androidTests/connected/index.html
```

## Run unit tests

None yet :(

## Building javadocs

```sh
$ .gradlew -q buildDocs
```

Now look at the new Javadocs!

```sh
$ firefox build/javadoc/index.html
```
